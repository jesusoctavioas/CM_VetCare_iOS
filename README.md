# CM_VetCare_iOS

Assistant for animal nursing, with reminders and easier health collection. 

## Concept

Animals in pet hospitals have a treatment plan that nurses must apply at given times. The app should act as a reminder, to “enforce” the plan for each animal. 
In addition, biosignals monitoring could help tracking the animal conditions.
An important point is to be able to quickly identify an animal.
